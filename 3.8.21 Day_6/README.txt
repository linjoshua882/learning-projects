Today's code was made for a specific purpose: to take Uber passenger pickup data from April 2014 in NYC and find the ways to make models and create insights from the data.

This is to:
a) practice data modelling, analytics, and manipulating large datasets.
b) have a project to show potential future employers.

The data consists of 546,000 lines of data that includes time, date, latitude, and longitude of passenger pickups. With this .csv, I have:
1) Examined frequency of pickups by the day of the month,
2) Examined frequency of pickups by the day of the week,
3) Examined frequency of pickups by the hour of the day,
4) Examined frequency of pickups by longitude and latitude.

With this information, Uber drivers could minimize the amount of time and gas that it takes to pick up new passengers, thus maximizing profit/time ratio, and lowering gas costs.

If this were a real scenario, Uber could use this code and sell passenger activity information to Uber drivers as a SaaS, creating more revenue for Uber as well.
